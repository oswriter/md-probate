# md-probate
Maryland probate fees calculator for Python

## Features
This is a simple Python script that calcuates the probate fees for a probate estate opened in the State of Maryland.

The program asks the user to enter the value of a decedent's *gross estate* and then calculates two items:
- The *probate fee* owed by the estate to the [Register of Wills](http://registers.maryland.gov/main/); and
- The maximum *personal representative's commission* and/or *attorney's fees* that the estate may pay.

Please note, the maximum PR/attorney's fees only apply when the decedent's will does not provide for a larger amount.

## Usage
The program asks you to input the value of the decedent's *gross estate* without any currency ($) or commas (,). 

## Disclaimer
This program **does not offer legal advice**. If you have any questions regarding the administration of a Maryland estate, you should speak with a qualified probate attorney.
